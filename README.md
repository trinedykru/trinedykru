### Hi, I’m Trinedy *(pronounced Tri-nuh-dee)*
I have a BA in Industrial Design, and have spent the first chapter of my career designing art materials (paint brushes, sculpting tools, retail displays for art stores). I’ve always enjoyed making things that bring joy and utility to people. Now, I’d like to make things in a Web3 world, so I am taking CompSci classes at SMC to enhance my skill set. I’m interested in NFTs, and functional cryptocurrency types, not so much into the hype of the ones that only hold value. Immersive experiences, AR / VR, wearables, smart home integration are all things I’m excited for in the coming future. 🐇
