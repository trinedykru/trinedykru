### Hi, Iâ€™m Trinedy *(pronounced Tri-nuh-dee)*
My background is in Product Design and UX. Creating useful and delightful experiences through thoughtful and creative problem-solving has always been the most rewarding part of the work I do. After a decade of designing products for the physical world, I transitioned to forming experiences in the virtual world that educate and enhance our lives in the physical world. Currently focused on designing web experiences and applications for the health, fitness, & education.
