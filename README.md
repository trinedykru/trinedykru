- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @trinedykru Trinedy (pronounced Trin-eh-dee)
I have my undergrad degree in Industrial Design and have practiced for the last 10+ years. Iâ€™m looking to enhance my skill set, aiming for an SMC certificate in Computer Programming. Iâ€™m still undecided if I will transfer out to complete a second baccalaureate or see what sort of job I can get with just the skills I learn from SMC. I love design, and UX, so Iâ€™m thinking front end is where Iâ€™d like to end up. Outside of tech, I like to ride bikes (the human-powered kind), bake treats, and watch movies. Iâ€™m a mom of 4, holla out to fellow mamas out there hustling and learning to code! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Databases | Internet Programming | C programming at SMC
