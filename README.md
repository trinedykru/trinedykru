# Hi, I'm Trinedy üëã

*From hands-on products to human-centered pixels.*

## About Me

I started my design journey in 2009, after earning a BFA in product design from Columbia College Chicago‚Äîwhile raising my first son as a single mom. That experience shaped everything I believe now: that creativity is powerful, education should be accessible, and everyone deserves the chance to build something meaningful.

Early in my career, I designed everything from outdoor cookware to artist tools and trade show displays. But what I really loved were the products that made someone's day just a little easier or more joyful. I've always been drawn to the intersection of practical and beautiful.

After moving to Los Angeles and growing my family, I returned to school to study computer science at Santa Monica College. That's when I discovered web design‚Äîa space where I could combine storytelling, problem-solving, and visual design. Since 2019, I've been building websites that reflect the heart of the businesses behind them.

## What I Do

Today, I run **Ube Bread**, a web design studio based in Santa Monica. I design intentional, human-centered websites for small businesses and local organizations. 

**My services include:**
- Custom web design
- Content strategy
- Local SEO
- Email marketing
- Product photography
- Branding and logo design

All crafted to work together and bring small businesses online in a way that feels true to who they are.

## My Philosophy

I believe the internet doesn't have to feel cold or corporate. It can feel personal. Reflective. Empowering. Whether I'm collaborating on a client project or writing a blog post, I want design and tech to feel a little less intimidating‚Äîand a little more like home.

### What I care about:
- **Supporting small business owners** who don't speak "tech" but still want to show up online with confidence
- **Mentoring junior designers** and self-taught creatives who are figuring things out while juggling life
- **Empowering women, moms, and underrepresented folks** who have big dreams and messy schedules‚Äîjust like I did

## My Approach

I design like I live: with care, purpose, and plenty of room for imperfection. My work blends my background in product design with a deep respect for structure, storytelling, and the way people actually use the web. 

Because at the end of the day, I'm not just building websites‚ÄîI'm helping real people bring their ideas to life, share their work with the world, and connect more meaningfully with the communities they serve.
