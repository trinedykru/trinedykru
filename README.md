### Hi, I’m Trinedy *(pronounced Tri-nuh-dee)*
I have my undergrad degree in Industrial Design and have practiced for the last 10+ years. I’m looking to enhance my skill set, aiming for an SMC certificate in Computer Programming. I’m still undecided if I will transfer out to complete a second baccalaureate or see what sort of job I can get with just the skills I learn from SMC. I love design, and UX, so I’m thinking front end is where I’d like to end up. Outside of tech, I like to ride bikes (the human-powered kind), bake treats, and watch movies. I’m a mom of 4, holla out to fellow mamas out there hustling and learning to code! 🐇
